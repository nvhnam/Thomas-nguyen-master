                Music has always been an important part of my life since the
                early days, it helps me express my emotions and become one of
                the main inspirations for me to get up every day and improve
                myself. Besides that, it is also a reason why I learn to play a
                musical instrument and that made me discover some of the
                abilities that I never thought I would have had.
